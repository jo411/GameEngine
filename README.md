-----------------------------------------------Assignment 2.0(4/5) notes---------------------------------------------------------------

 Monster_Chase.cpp is where all the main startup code is located for this assignment. 
SmartPointer.h and WeakPointer.h inside the engine hold exactly what their names suggest 
RefCounter.h in the engine holds the reference counter
Monster_Chase.cpp holds the tests I created. I turned off the display for this assignment. 
Person.h is a simple class I use in my tests. A person holds a name and age and can speak it to the output buffer.
